Bonus Points:
10 points - you add the ability to upgrade your towers
10 points - enemies are smarter and can follow different paths based on where you place your towers
10 points - artistic polish (your game is beautiful and feels like a final project with features like a title screen, audio elements, and a cohesive aesthetic). These are not just 10 free points, you need to actually impress me with how your game feels and include your specific efforts and decisions in your README.
